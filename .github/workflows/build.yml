      # Step 1: Checks out your repository's code onto the runner
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # Step 2: Sets up Node.js so we can use npm commands

        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '18' # Use a stable Long-Term Support version of Node.js
          cache: 'npm'      # This speeds up the 'npm install' step on future runs

      # Step 3: Installs the dependencies from your package.json file
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install

      # Step 4: Runs the "build" script from your package.json
      # This is where electron-builder creates the .dmg file in a 'dist' folder.
      - name: Build application
        run: npm run build

      # Step 5: Uploads the final .dmg file from the 'dist' folder
      # so you can download it from the GitHub Actions page.
