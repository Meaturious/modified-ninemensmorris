Nine Men's Morris for web, macOS and Windows.

## Game Modes
### Classic
Classic Mode is the traditional Nine Men's Morris experience, a game of strategy in three distinct phases:

Placing Phase: Players take turns placing their nine pieces on any empty point on the board.

Moving Phase: Once all pieces are placed, players slide their pieces to adjacent empty points along the lines. The goal is to form a "mill" – a row of three of your pieces.

Flying Phase: When a player is reduced to only three pieces, their pieces can "fly" to any empty point on the board, not just adjacent ones.

Forming a mill in Classic Mode allows you to remove one of your opponent's pieces from the board. The game is won by reducing your opponent to two pieces or by blocking them from making any legal moves.

### Simple
Simple Mode is a faster, more direct version of the game, perfect for a quick match.

In this mode, the core objective is simplified: be the first to form a mill. The game consists of only the "Placing Phase." Players take turns placing their pieces on the board one by one. The moment a player successfully places a piece to complete a line of three, the game ends immediately, and that player is declared the winner. There is no moving, flying, or removing of opponent's piece
